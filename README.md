# RandomPythonGarbage
stuff i coded in python, initially for a coding class but eventually will just be a backup of every .py i write. feel free to mock
# tictactoe.py
literally just command line tic tac toe. doesnt seem to crash anymore, may actually be worth using if you're into that kind of thing.
