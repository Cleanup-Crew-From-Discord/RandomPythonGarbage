# RandomPythonGarbage
stuff i coded in python, initially for a coding class but eventually will just be a backup of every .py i write. feel free to mock
# tictactoe.py
literally just command line tic tac toe. doesnt seem to crash anymore, may actually be worth using if you're into that kind of thing.
# playlistBuild.py
Now this one is actually pretty nice. Recursively scans all subfolders and fetches album Metadata, organizing it into two lists. It creates an album list that also can tell whether or not the music was web ripped or CD ripped from the quality of mp3, and a song list with name, artist, album, length, size, and quality. Designed to work with ABCDE / files tagged with musicbrainz but should work with any tagged mp3s.
